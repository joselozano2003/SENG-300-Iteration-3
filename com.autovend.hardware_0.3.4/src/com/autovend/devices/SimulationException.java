 * An exception that can be raised when the behaviour within the simulator makes

 * different from an exception being raised because the preconditions of a
 * component are violated. For example, it makes no sense to move a coin from
 * the coin slot to the coin tray if the coin tray does not exist or is not
 * connected to the coin slot; this would cause a SimulationException.
 * <p>
 * Sometimes, the SimulationException wraps another exception, called the nested
 * exception.
