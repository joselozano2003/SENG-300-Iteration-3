/**
 * Simulates the overall self-checkout station.
 * <p>
 * A self-checkout possesses the following units of hardware that the customer
 * can see and interact with:
 * <ul>
 * <li>two electronic scales (one in the bagging area and one near the scanner),
 * with a configurable maximum weight before it overloads;</li>
 * <li>one touch screen;</li>
 * <li>one receipt printer;</li>
 * <li>one card reader;</li>
 * <li>two scanners (the main one and the handheld one);</li>
 * <li>one input slot for bills;</li>
 * <li>one output slot for bills;</li>
 * <li>one input slot for coins;</li>
 * <li>one output tray for coins; and,</li>
 * <li>one speaker for audio output (note: you should directly use the
 * {@link AudioSystem} class, if you want to produce sounds).</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In addition, these units of hardware are accessible to personnel with a key
 * to unlock the front of the station:
 * <li>one bill storage unit, with configurable capacity;</li>
 * <li>one or more bill dispensers, one for each supported denomination of bill,
 * as configured;</li>
 * <li>one coin storage unit, with configurable capacity; and,</li>
 * <li>one or more coin dispensers, one for each supported denomination of coin,
 * as configured.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * And finally, there are certain, additional units of hardware that would only
 * be accessible to someone with the appropriate tools (like a screwdriver,
 * crowbar, or sledge hammer):
 * <ul>
 * <li>one bill validator; and</li>
 * <li>one coin validator.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Many of these devices are interconnected, to permit coins or bills to pass
 * between them. Specifically:
 * <ul>
 * <li>the coin slot is connected to the coin validator (this is a
 * one-directional chain of devices);</li>
 * <li>the coin validator is connected to each of the coin dispensers (i.e., the
 * coin dispensers can be replenished with coins entered by customers), to the
 * coin storage unit (for any overflow coins that do not fit in the dispensers),
 * and to the coin tray for any rejected coins either because the coins are
 * invalid or because even the overflow storage unit is full (this is a
 * one-directional chain of devices);
 * <li>each coin dispenser is connected to the coin tray, to provide change
 * (this is a one-directional chain of devices);</li>
 * <li>the bill input slot is connected to the bill validator (this is a
 * <b>two</b>-directional chain of devices as an entered bills that are rejected
 * by the validator can be returned to the customer);</li>
 * <li>the bill validator is connected to the bill storage unit (this is a
 * one-directional chain of devices); and,</li>
 * <li>each bill dispenser is connected to the output bill slot; these
 * dispensers cannot be replenished by bills provided by customers (this is a
 * one-directional chain of devices).</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * All other functionality of the system must be performed in software,
 * installed on the self-checkout station through custom listener classes
 * implementing the various listener interfaces provided.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that bill denominations are required to be positive integers, while coin
 * denominations are positive decimal values ({@link BigDecimal} is used for the
 * latter to avoid roundoff problems arising from floating-point operations).
