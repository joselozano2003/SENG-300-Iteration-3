- [x]  check names and ucids for any corrections
- [ ]  read through project iteration and demonstration descriptions
    - Project Iteration 3 DESCRIPTION
        - [ ]  which project iteration 2 code do we build on?
            - Ach and Mariannaâ€™s ?
            - Oscarâ€™s?
        - OVERVIEW: The third and final iteration is the most complex yet. Your team is now big and simply organizing and managing it will become a task in itself.
        - download **com.autovend.hardware_0.3.** Do not alter.
        - tasks
            - [ ]  complete all remaining use cases in use case model (v3.0)
            
            [](https://d2l.ucalgary.ca/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=497088&type=coursefile&fileId=Autovend+UC+3.pdf)
            
            - [ ]  update and complete existing use cases from previous iterations
            - [ ]  develop a GUI for self-checkout station and for attendant station using Java Swing
                - You will need GUIs for each of a set of DoItYourselfStations and an AttendantStation. I would suggest that you consider providing separate GUIs to simulate customer input, attendant input, and provide a means of showing what change is returned and what is printed on the receipt.
            - [ ]  decide which repo to build on
            - [ ]  automated test suite for testing. junit. gui tested by interation
            - [ ]  begin source file with comment with membersâ€™ names above
            - [ ]  optional supplementary one page explanation about how application works
            - [ ]  provide a git log
            - [ ]  detailed structure diagram to explain how application works
                - [ ]  in this situation, what is important is to be complete in terms of the types, packages, and relationships between all of these. You should only show dependencies, containment, and generalization. Do not show association, aggregation, or composition: each of these implies dependency as well, so just show us the dependencies.
            - [ ]  prepare and record a demonstration of your final product
            - ASPECTS OF WORK (to assign later)

            - ðŸ’¡ CURRENT IDEA: DIVIDE AND CONQUER APPROACH, HIERARCHY
                - good # of groups? 6 groups of 4 people. (2 for soft dev, 2 for testing?):
                    - subgroup can have their own meetings
                        - then at least one representative per each subgroup with main group
                    - how do tasks get assigned in one group?
